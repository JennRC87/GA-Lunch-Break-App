* GA Lunch Break is an fun app for prospective and current General Assembly NYC students to highlight and review their favorite neighborhood spots to eat, drink and hangout. Immersives go by fast. Don’t waste your time eating crappy food!
* The idea for this app emerged from wanting to create a useful tool for GA students to explore the cool restaurants, dive bars, coffee shops and more scattered around their new neighborhood, encompassing the Flatiron District, Union Square and Chelsea. GA immersives can be as short as a one-day bootcamp to as long as 12-weeks. For a busy student seeking a sweet break from another intense day, it’s a huge relief to log on to the app, check out a highly reviewed lunch spot a few minutes away, and grab lunch from a place they might not have otherwise heard of.
* Isolated coffee shops. Dope Halal food. The best burger in New York City. The cheapest beers this side of the 5 Train. This app is for you.
